# Dan Cureatz's Data Portfolio

[Spotify Revenue and User Report](https://github.com/DJTC3rd/portfolio_projects/tree/main/Spotify%20Analysis)

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Spotify's subscription plan and regional performance by examining sales and total user counts. This analysis utilized a self-created synthetic dataset, based on published aggregate metrics from Spotify, consisting of over 400k revenue events.

I utilized SQL and python for data analysis and cleaning, and built a performance dashboard in Power BI to visualize trends in revenue and user counts, segmented by subscription plan type and user region.

The project aimed to surface actionable insights for the Marketing and Product teams, focusing on identifying underperforming regions and plans, along with providing recommendations for next steps.
